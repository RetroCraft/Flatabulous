# Base16 Theme
This is a fork of the Flatabulous theme for Debian Linux systems, which is in turn based on the Ultra-Flat theme. Special thanks to  anmoljagetia, @steftrikia and Satyajit Sahoo for the original work. The theme uses the colors from chriskempson's [base16](chriskempson.github.io/base16/) theme.

# Flat Icons
Fork of ultra-flat-icons coming soon
